# cuDF-Pandas-Accelerator
cuDF is a Python GPU DataFrame library (built on the Apache Arrow columnar memory format) for loading, joining, aggregating, filtering, and otherwise manipulating data. cuDF also provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers &amp; data scientists, so they can use it to easily accelerate their workflows.
cudf.pandas is built on cuDF and accelerates pandas code on the GPU. It supports 100% of the pandas API, using the GPU for supported operations, and automatically falling back to pandas for other operations.
